Tagalog is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. According to Ethnologue, there are about 28 million native speakers of Tagalog and 82 million total speakers as of 2022[^1^]. Tagalog is also spoken by Filipino communities in many countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and more.
 
Tagalog belongs to the Austronesian language family, which includes languages spoken in Southeast Asia, Oceania, Madagascar, and Taiwan. Tagalog is closely related to other Philippine languages, such as Bikol, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Kapampangan, and Pangasinan. Tagalog also has many loanwords from Spanish, English, Chinese, Arabic, and other languages.
 
Tagalog has a complex system of verbal affixes that indicate the focus, aspect, mood, and voice of the verb. For example, the verb basa (read) can have different forms depending on the role of the subject and object in the sentence. The form bumasa means 'to read something', while binasa means 'to have read something'. The form magbasa means 'to read something habitually', while nagbasa means 'to have read something habitually'. The form basahin means 'to read something (as an order)', while binasahan means 'to read something to someone'.
  
## Tagalog Alphabet and Pronunciation
 
The Tagalog alphabet is based on the Latin script, which means that it uses the same letters as many other languages, such as English, Spanish, French, and German. However, there are some differences in how these letters are pronounced and used in Tagalog.
 
The modern Tagalog alphabet has 28 letters: 23 consonants and 5 vowels. The consonants are B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Ã, Ng, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, and Z. The vowels are A, E, I, O, and U. Some of these letters are only used for foreign words or names.
 
The pronunciation of the Tagalog letters is similar to their pronunciation in English or Spanish. However, there are some exceptions and variations that you should be aware of. Here are some tips and examples to help you pronounce the Tagalog alphabet correctly:
 
- The letter C is pronounced as /k/ or /s/, depending on the word. For example: cactus (/kaktus/), civil (/sibil/).
- The letter F is pronounced as /f/ or /p/, depending on the word. For example: film (/film/), fideo (/pideo/).

For example: ama (/ama/), aanihin (/aËnihin/), edukasyon (/edukasjon/), eepal (/eËpal/), ibon (/ibon/), iisipin (/iËsipin/), oso (/oso/), oo (/oË/), ulan (/ulan/), uulitin (/uËlitin/).
